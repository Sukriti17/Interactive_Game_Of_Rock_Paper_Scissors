HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML serves as the backbone of your project, defining the structure and content of your web pages. In the context of your game, HTML plays several crucial roles:

Structure: HTML organizes the game interface into a structured layout. It defines elements such as buttons, score displays, and the game board where players make their selections.

User Interface: HTML is responsible for creating the visual components of your game, including the buttons for rock, paper, and scissors, as well as any images or text elements used for instructions.

Links and References: HTML provides links to external resources, such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files, ensuring that your game is properly styled and functional.

Interaction: HTML elements, like buttons, serve as interactive components that users can click on to make their choices and trigger actions within the game.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS is responsible for the presentation and styling of your web game. It enhances the user experience by making the game visually appealing and user-friendly:

Layout and Design: CSS defines the layout of the game elements, their positioning, size, and appearance. It ensures that the game interface is aesthetically pleasing and responsive to different screen sizes.

Colors and Fonts: CSS controls the color scheme, typography, and overall design aesthetics of your game. It allows you to choose colors for buttons, background, and text, as well as select appropriate fonts for a cohesive visual identity.

Animations and Transitions: CSS animations and transitions can be used to create engaging visual effects, such as button hover animations or transitions when revealing the computer's choice.

Responsiveness: CSS makes your game responsive, ensuring that it adapts gracefully to various devices, from mobile phones to desktops, by adjusting the layout and styling accordingly.

JavaScript
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript is the dynamic scripting language that breathes life into your Rock, Paper, Scissors web game. It is responsible for the game's logic and interactivity:

Game Logic: JavaScript implements the rules of the game, such as determining the winner based on the player's choice and the computer's choice. It keeps track of scores and updates them accordingly.

User Interaction: JavaScript listens for user input, such as clicks on the rock, paper, and scissors buttons, and responds to these actions by processing the player's choice and initiating the game's outcome.

Computer AI: In single-player mode, JavaScript generates a random choice for the computer, simulating the opponent's moves. It then compares this choice to the player's selection to determine the winner.

Dynamic Updates: JavaScript dynamically updates the game interface by displaying the computer's choice, announcing the winner of each round, and keeping a running tally of scores.

Game Flow: JavaScript manages the flow of the game, including starting new rounds, announcing the winner of the game, and providing options to play again or switch game modes.
